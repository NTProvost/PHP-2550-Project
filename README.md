# Repository for the Final Project in PHP 2550, Fall 2022 for Nathan Provost and Antonella Basso

## Progress as of 11/13/2022:

This repository contains the R file, R Markdown file, and PDF rendering of the R Markdown file we used for our project, which currently only employs exploratory data analysis methods and a brief literature review. We begin by exploring some of the quantitative and qualitative work that has already been done regarding the propagation of listeria as a foodborne illness. We discuss many of the biological studies that have builti phylogenetic models of listeria and worked to identify which strains of listeria (as classified by serovar) tend to be the worst for human health. We then explore some more quantitative studies that have examined the impact of listeria, what they found, and how their methods worked. Though we do discuss the methods of these studies, we try not to go into too much detail, mainly discussing which methods worked better than others.

We then moved on to some exploratory data analysis. We began by discussing the dataset available to us, where it came from, how it was assembled, and what its major flaws are. We then examined the distributions of two numerical variables throughly, and grouped different visualizations of them by sources to get a sense of the mechanisms in the dataset. We examined the missingness of the variables in the dataset, which was substantial. We commented on the locations present in the dataset and which kinds of listeria serovars were present. Finally, we summarized our results and discuss future modeling considerations.

A methodological plan with a rough analysis was then added, with the appropriate PDF, R Markdown file, and R file. Our goals were updated and revised and went outlined our plan moving forward. We then tested out a few key features of our methodologies and updated this repository
