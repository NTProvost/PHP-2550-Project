# Repository for the Final Project in PHP 2550, Fall 2022 for Nathan Provost and Antonella Basso

## Progress as of 10/23/2022:

This repository contains the R file, R Markdown file, and PDF rendering of the R Markdown file we used for our project, which currently only employs exploratory data analysis methods and a brief literature review. We begin by exploring some of the quantitative and qualitative work that has already been done regarding the propagation of listeria as a foodborne illness. We discuss many of the biological studies that have builti phylogenetic models of listeria and worked to identify which strains of listeria (as classified by serovar) tend to be the worst for human health. We then explore some more quantitative studies that have examined the impact of listeria, what they found, and how their methods worked. Though we do discuss the methods of these studies, we try not to go into too much detail, mainly discussing which methods worked better than others. More detailed information on methodology will be included in the methods section.

We then moved on to some exploratory data analysis. We began by discussing the dataset available to us, where it came from, how it was assembled, and what its major flaws are. We then examined the distributions of two numerical variables throughly, and grouped different visualizations of them by sources to get a sense of the mechanisms in the dataset. We examined the missingness of the variables in the dataset, which was substantial. We commented on the locations present in the dataset and which kinds of listeria serovars were present. Finally, we summarized our results and discuss future modeling considerations.

## Summary of Files Included

The R Markdown file (Final Project.Rmd) in this repository is what was used to generate the PDF report (Final.Project.10.23.2022) that is also present in the repository.

The R file (Final Project Code.R) contains all the code in the code appendix of the R Markdown file without any text.

The .csv file LMdata contains the data that we primarily used throughout our analysis.

The .bib file contains the sources used and cited in our report and code.

We could not upload a dataset containining all the variables we did not use, but since most of them were missing and we addressed them as needed in the PDF report, not much is lost from this.
